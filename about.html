                    <summary>What is Co-operative ?</summary>
                    <p>A cooperative, or co-op, is an organization or business entity owned and operated by a group of individuals who have a shared interest or goal. Unlike traditional businesses where profits are distributed to shareholders, cooperatives are typically focused on meeting the needs and interests of their members.</p>

                        <summary>What is Co-operative Bank ?</summary>
                        <p>A cooperative bank is a financial institution owned and controlled by its members, who are also its customers. Unlike traditional banks, which are driven by profit and shareholder interests, cooperative banks operate on the principle of democratic member control, where each member typically has one vote regardless of their investment level. They focus on serving the needs of their members, often offering favorable rates and lower fees, and reinvesting profits into the bank or distributing them among members. </p>

They offer democratic control with one member, one vote, and often reinvest profits into the bank or distribute them among members, rather than focusing solely on maximizing shareholder returns.</p>
